1. install mkvtoolnix
	$sudo apt-get install mkvtoolnix
2. For extract subtittle we need know number of track. input.mkv is movie for example.
	$mkvmerge -i input.mkv
	output for command above.

	File 'input.mkv': container: Matroska
	Track ID 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)
	Track ID 2: audio (A_AAC)
	Track ID 3: subtitles (S_TEXT/UTF8)
3. Subtittle is under track ID 3 with mkvextract command can separate subtittle
	$mkvextract tracks input.mkv 3:subtittle.srt
	command take 3 input: name of mkv file, number of track ID and name of output file.
	mkvextract tracks <name mkv movie in current directory> <trackID>:<full output name>
	For repeate command over all mkv file in directory execute below command:
	a=1 && for i in *.mkv; do mkvextract tracks “$i” 3:$a.srt && let a=a+1; done
4. Now we have file with subtittle but is not in state for read in movie.
